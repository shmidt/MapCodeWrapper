# MapCodeWrapper
Simple Objective C wrapper for MapCode C library.
I use it in my http://appstore.com/mapcode app.

`#import "MapcodeHelper.h"` and you are ready to convert coordinates to mapcodes and back.

There is also Swift helper, but it's actually uses Objective C wrapper, just making calls nicer. 



*Please note, that I don't work for MapCode or TomTom companies. *
